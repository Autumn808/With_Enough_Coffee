Security is a key passion of mine, and I co-host the podcast "ShipIt" on Changelog, where we dive into the intricacies of infrastructure and DevOps, exploring everything that happens after a Git push. I believe in the power of community and collaboration, and Iâ€™m dedicated to making technology accessible to all. I've spoken at conferences like the GraceHopper Celebration, Apache World Part, SheBuilds, AWEsome, the Southern Califronia Linux Expo aka Scale, and Github Universe. I enjoy advocating and helping in my community, I sit on the Board of Directors for the Snohomish County United Way and am on the advocacy board. All thoughts are my own.
